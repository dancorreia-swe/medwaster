# Sidebar Component Contract

## Interface Definition

```typescript
interface SidebarProps {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  defaultExpanded?: boolean;
  userProfile?: UserProfile;
  navigationItems?: NavigationItem[];
  onToggle?: (isExpanded: boolean) => void;
}
```

## Component Behavior Contract

### Rendering Requirements
- MUST render a navigation sidebar on the left side of the screen
- MUST display navigation items with icons and labels
- MUST show user profile information at the bottom (admin/super-admin only)
- MUST support both expanded and collapsed states
- MUST handle authentication state and role-based access

### State Management Requirements
- MUST persist expansion state across browser sessions
- MUST respond to viewport changes for responsive behavior
- MUST update active navigation item based on current route
- MUST provide smooth transitions between states

### Accessibility Requirements
- MUST include proper ARIA labels and roles
- MUST support keyboard navigation
- MUST announce state changes to screen readers
- MUST maintain focus management during state transitions

### Responsive Behavior Requirements
- MUST collapse to overlay mode on mobile devices (< 768px)
- MUST auto-collapse on tablet devices (768px - 1024px)
- MUST allow manual toggle on desktop devices (> 1024px)

### Authentication Requirements
- MUST only render for authenticated users with admin or super-admin roles
- MUST handle unauthenticated state gracefully
- MUST not display for regular user roles
- MUST redirect unauthorized users appropriately

## Event Contracts

### onToggle Event
```typescript
type ToggleHandler = (isExpanded: boolean) => void;
```
- Fired when sidebar expansion state changes
- Provides current state as boolean parameter

### onNavigate Event
```typescript
type NavigateHandler = (item: NavigationItem) => void;
```
- Fired when user clicks navigation item
- Provides clicked navigation item data

## Testing Contracts

### Unit Test Requirements
- MUST test expansion/collapse functionality
- MUST test responsive behavior simulation
- MUST test keyboard navigation
- MUST test state persistence

### Integration Test Requirements
- MUST test navigation item routing
- MUST test user profile display
- MUST test responsive layout changes
- MUST test accessibility features

## Performance Contracts

### Animation Performance
- Animation transitions MUST complete within 300ms
- Frame rate MUST maintain 60fps during transitions
- Layout shifts MUST be minimized during state changes

### Memory Usage
- Component MUST clean up event listeners on unmount
- State persistence MUST not cause memory leaks
- Re-renders MUST be optimized with proper memoization
