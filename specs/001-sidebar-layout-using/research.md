# Research: Sidebar Layout with ShadCN Components

## ShadCN Sidebar Component Architecture

**Decision**: Use ShadCN's sidebar component as the base with custom implementation
**Rationale**: 
- ShadCN provides production-ready accessibility features
- Built-in responsive behavior and state management
- Consistent with existing design system
- Well-documented patterns for sidebar layouts
**Alternatives Considered**: Custom implementation, Headless UI, Radix primitives directly

## State Management Approach

**Decision**: Combine React Context with localStorage for persistent state
**Rationale**: 
- Context provides app-wide access to sidebar state
- localStorage enables state persistence across browser sessions
- Minimal complexity for single-component state
- ShadCN components integrate well with context patterns
**Alternatives Considered**: Zustand, Redux, URL-based state

## Responsive Design Strategy

**Decision**: CSS-based responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
**Rationale**: 
- ShadCN components are built with Tailwind CSS
- Consistent breakpoint system across the application
- Performant CSS-only approach
- Mobile-first design aligns with modern practices
**Alternatives Considered**: JavaScript-based responsive logic, matchMedia API

## Navigation Structure

**Decision**: Icon + text layout with conditional rendering based on sidebar state
**Rationale**: 
- Clear visual hierarchy in expanded state
- Space-efficient icons-only in collapsed state
- Maintains usability in both states
- Standard pattern users expect
**Alternatives Considered**: Text-only, icon-only, nested menu structure

## Authentication and Role-Based Access

**Decision**: Implement role-based access control at the authentication level
**Rationale**: 
- Web application is restricted to super-admin and admin users only
- Regular users should not be able to authenticate to the web interface
- Role checking prevents unauthorized access to sidebar and navigation
- Clear separation between web admin interface and other client applications
**Alternatives Considered**: Role-based UI hiding, post-authentication role checks, universal access

## User Profile Display

**Decision**: Fixed bottom position with avatar, name, and role (admin/super-admin only)
**Rationale**: 
- Always visible for admin user context
- Bottom placement follows common sidebar patterns
- Role display is important for administrative interfaces
- Condensed view in collapsed state maintains identity
**Alternatives Considered**: Top placement, dropdown menu, separate component

## Animation and Transitions

**Decision**: CSS transitions with transform properties for smooth animations
**Rationale**: 
- Smooth user experience during state changes
- Hardware-accelerated transforms for performance
- ShadCN components include built-in animation support
- Consistent with modern web app expectations
**Alternatives Considered**: No animations, Framer Motion, React Spring

## Accessibility Considerations

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
**Rationale**: 
- ShadCN components include accessibility features by default
- Navigation should be fully keyboard accessible
- Screen readers need proper landmark and role attributes
- Essential for inclusive user experience
**Alternatives Considered**: Basic accessibility, WCAG AAA compliance

## Integration with TanStack Router

**Decision**: Use router's Link components for navigation items
**Rationale**: 
- Consistent with existing routing architecture
- Proper active state management
- Client-side navigation performance
- SEO and browser history benefits
**Alternatives Considered**: Custom navigation handling, manual route changes
