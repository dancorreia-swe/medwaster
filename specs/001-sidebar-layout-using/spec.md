## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: Should sidebar state (expanded/minimized) persist across browser sessions? → A: Yes, ShadCN sidebar components and documentation can handle state persistence
- Q: Which navigation items should be included in the sidebar? → A: Dashboard, Questions, Wiki, Profile
- Q: How should the sidebar behave on mobile/tablet devices? → A: Responsive collapse: auto-minimize on tablet, overlay drawer on mobile (ShadCN component handles implementation)
- Q: What user roles can access the web application? → A: Only super-admin and admin roles can access the web. Regular users cannot login to the web interface

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a web application user, I need a sidebar navigation that provides quick access to application features while displaying my account information, and I want the ability to minimize it to save screen space when working with content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is logged into the web application, **When** they view any page, **Then** they see a sidebar on the left with navigation items and their user profile information (username, email, role) displayed at the bottom
2. **Given** the sidebar is in expanded state, **When** the user clicks the minimize/collapse button, **Then** the sidebar contracts to show only icons and the user profile becomes condensed
3. **Given** the sidebar is in minimized state, **When** the user clicks the expand button or hovers over the sidebar, **Then** the sidebar expands to show full navigation labels and complete user profile information
4. **Given** the sidebar is displayed, **When** the user interacts with navigation items, **Then** they can navigate to different sections of the application

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's username or email is very long and doesn't fit in the sidebar?
- How does the sidebar behave on mobile devices or smaller screen sizes?
- What happens when user profile information is loading or unavailable?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a sidebar navigation component on the left side of the web application
- **FR-002**: Sidebar MUST show the current user's username, email address, and role at the bottom section
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to minimize/collapse the sidebar to a compact icon-only view
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to expand the sidebar from minimized state to full view
- **FR-005**: Sidebar MUST maintain its state (expanded/minimized) during the user session and persist across browser sessions
- **FR-006**: Sidebar MUST be built using ShadCN component library for consistent styling
- **FR-007**: System MUST display navigation items in the sidebar for application routing: Dashboard, Questions, Wiki, and Profile sections
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle responsive design for the sidebar: auto-minimize on tablet breakpoints, overlay drawer on mobile breakpoints, with ShadCN component handling responsive behavior

- **FR-009**: System MUST restrict web application access to only super-admin and admin user roles

### Key Entities
