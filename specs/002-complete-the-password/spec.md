# Feature Specification: Password Recovery and Audit Logging

**Feature Branch**: `002-complete-the-password`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Complete the Password Recovery and Audit Logging features for the MedWaster Learning authentication system. 

For Password Recovery (RF005):
- Implement the sendResetPassword function in Better Auth configuration to send password reset emails using the existing forget-password.tsx template
- Add email service configuration for SMTP/email provider integration  
- Ensure secure token generation and expiration handling
- Add rate limiting for password reset requests to prevent abuse

For Audit Logging (RF006):
- Create comprehensive audit logging system that tracks all authentication events and critical user actions
- Log login attempts (successful and failed), password resets, role changes, account creation/deletion
- Store audit logs with timestamp, user ID, action type, IP address, user agent, and additional context
- Implement log retention policies and secure storage
- Provide audit log viewing capabilities for super-admins
- Include GDPR-compliant data handling for audit logs

The system should integrate seamlessly with the existing Better Auth setup, use the established database schema patterns, and follow the MedWaster security requirements."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: What should be the token expiration time for password resets? ‚Üí A: 1 hour (balances security with user convenience)
- Q: How many password reset requests should be allowed per user per time period? ‚Üí A: 5 requests per hour (prevents abuse while allowing legitimate use)
- Q: Should password reset tokens be IP-restricted or just logged? ‚Üí A: Just logged for security monitoring (users may access from different networks)
- Q: Which email service provider should be used? ‚Üí A: SMTP (flexible and compatible with various providers)
- Q: What audit log retention period is required? ‚Üí A: 7 years (medical industry compliance standard)

### Session 2024-12-19 - Better Auth Password Reset Review
- Q: Should we create custom password reset API endpoints? ‚Üí A: No, Better Auth provides built-in `/request-password-reset` and `/reset-password` endpoints
- Q: Do we need a custom password reset token schema? ‚Üí A: No, Better Auth uses the existing `verification` table for reset tokens
- Q: How should we handle token validation and expiration? ‚Üí A: Better Auth handles this automatically, we only need to implement `sendResetPassword` callback
- Q: Should we create custom rate limiting for password resets? ‚Üí A: Better Auth has built-in rate limiting, we can enhance with additional monitoring
- Q: What client methods should we use? ‚Üí A: `authClient.requestPasswordReset()` and `authClient.resetPassword()` (built-in methods)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the MedWaster Learning system, when I forget my password, I need to be able to securely reset it through email verification so I can regain access to my account without compromising security. Additionally, as a Super Admin, I need to monitor all security-related activities in the system to ensure compliance and detect potential threats.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Password Recovery Flow
1. **Given** a user has forgotten their password, **When** they request a password reset by entering their email, **Then** they receive a secure reset link via email within 5 minutes
2. **Given** a user clicks the password reset link, **When** the token is valid and not expired, **Then** they can create a new password and access their account
3. **Given** a user attempts multiple password reset requests, **When** they exceed the rate limit, **Then** subsequent requests are blocked for a cooling-off period
4. **Given** a user clicks an expired reset link, **When** they attempt to reset password, **Then** they receive an error message and must request a new link

#### Audit Logging Flow  
1. **Given** any user performs a security-sensitive action, **When** the action occurs, **Then** it is automatically logged with complete context information
2. **Given** a Super Admin wants to review security events, **When** they access the audit log interface, **Then** they can view, search, and filter all logged activities
3. **Given** audit logs reach retention limits, **When** the retention period expires, **Then** old logs are securely archived or deleted according to policy

### Edge Cases
- What happens when email delivery fails for password reset?
- How does system handle concurrent password reset attempts for the same user?
- What occurs when audit log storage approaches capacity limits?
- How does system behave if a malicious actor attempts to flood reset requests?
- What happens to audit logs when a user exercises GDPR right to be forgotten?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Password Recovery (RF005 Implementation)
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement `sendResetPassword` callback in Better Auth configuration to send password reset emails using existing template
