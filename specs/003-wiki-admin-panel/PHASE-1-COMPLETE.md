## 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

### **Content Processing Engine**
- **Smart Text Extraction**: Extracts plain text from complex BlockNote JSON for search indexing
- **Medical Content Support**: Handles custom medical blocks (procedures, alerts, equipment lists)
- **Reading Time Calculation**: 200 WPM baseline with 15% adjustment for technical medical content
- **Automatic Excerpt Generation**: Intelligent excerpt creation with sentence boundary detection
- **Content Validation**: Comprehensive validation with errors and warnings

### **Article Management**
- **Publication Workflow**: Draft → Published → Archived with validation
- **Category Integration**: Uses existing category system with wiki-type filtering
- **Tag System**: Many-to-many tagging with existing tag infrastructure
- **Search & Filtering**: Full-text search, category/author/tag/status filtering
- **Relationship Management**: Articles can reference related content, prerequisites, continuations

### **API Features**
- **Pagination**: Configurable page size (1-50 items)
- **Sorting**: By title, creation date, update date, view count
- **Role-Based Access**: Both admin and super_admin roles supported
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with specific error codes
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

## 📊 **Database Schema Highlights**

```sql
-- Main articles table with full content management
wiki_articles: 15 fields including JSONB content, search text, status, metadata

-- Performance indexes
- Full-text search index (PostgreSQL GIN)
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Status, category, author, date-based indexes

-- Relationships
- Articles ↔ Categories (many-to-one)
- Articles ↔ Tags (many-to-many)
- Articles ↔ Articles (relationships with types)
```

## 🧪 **Testing Coverage**
- ✅ Content processing and text extraction
- ✅ Word count and reading time calculation
- ✅ Custom medical block handling
- ✅ Slug generation with Portuguese character support
- ✅ Content validation with error detection
- ✅ Uniqueness handling for slugs
