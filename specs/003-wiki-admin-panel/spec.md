## üë• User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary Actor: Content Administrator
**Background**: Medical professionals or education coordinators responsible for creating and maintaining educational content about medical waste disposal procedures.

### Scenario 1: Creating New Educational Article
**Context**: Administrator needs to add information about a new waste disposal procedure
**Steps**:
1. Administrator logs into admin panel
2. Navigates to Wiki management section
3. Clicks "Create New Article"
4. Enters article title and selects appropriate category
5. Uses rich text editor to compose content with formatting, images, and links
6. Adds relevant tags for discoverability
7. Saves as draft for review
8. Reviews content and publishes when ready

**Expected Outcome**: New article is available in the knowledge base for students to access

### Scenario 2: Managing Content Categories
**Context**: Administrator needs to organize content with new waste categories
**Steps**:
1. Access category management section
2. Create new category with descriptive name and color coding
3. Set category hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
4. Assign appropriate access levels (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)
5. Move existing articles to new categories if needed

**Expected Outcome**: Improved content organization and easier navigation

### Scenario 3: Content Search and Bulk Operations
**Context**: Administrator needs to update multiple articles about a changed regulation
**Steps**:
1. Use search function to find articles by keyword or tag
2. Apply filters by category, status, or date
3. Select multiple articles from results
4. Perform bulk operations (status change, tag addition, category reassignment)
5. Preview changes before confirming

**Expected Outcome**: Efficient management of related content across the knowledge base

### Scenario 4: Publication Workflow Management
**Context**: Administrator needs to review and publish pending content
**Steps**:
1. View list of draft articles awaiting publication
2. Open article in preview mode to review formatting and content
3. Check for required fields (title, category, sufficient content)
4. Approve article for publication or return to draft with feedback
5. Monitor published articles for accuracy and engagement

**Expected Outcome**: Quality control ensures only approved content reaches students
