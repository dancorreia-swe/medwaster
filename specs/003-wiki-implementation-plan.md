# Wiki Admin Panel Implementation - Step-by-Step Guide

## Implementation Overview

Based on the analysis and requirements, I'll implement the Wiki admin panel in phases:

### Phase 1: Database Schema and Backend Services
1. Create database schema for enhanced wiki system
2. Implement file storage service with local storage
3. Create article service with CRUD operations
4. Add export service for PDF generation

### Phase 2: API Endpoints 
1. Implement article management endpoints
2. Create file upload and management endpoints
3. Add export endpoints

### Phase 3: Frontend Components
1. Create article listing with search/filters
2. Implement BlockNote.js editor integration
3. Build file management components
4. Add export functionality

## Implementation Progress

Let me start by implementing the database schema and basic services step by step.

## Key Points from Requirements Analysis

1. **Error Handling**: The current error handling works functionally (auth is correctly blocking unauthorized access) but needs JSON response formatting. This can be addressed in a later iteration.

2. **File Storage**: Start with local storage, design for S3 extensibility

3. **Editor**: Use BlockNote.js (already installed)

4. **Access Control**: For both admins and super admins

5. **PDF Export**: Include PDF export functionality

## Current System Analysis

The existing system has:
- ✅ Better Auth configured with RBAC
- ✅ Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Elysia backend with basic error handling
- ✅ BlockNote.js installed in frontend
- ✅ Basic wiki module structure
- ⚠️ Error handling works but returns text instead of JSON (can be fixed later)

## Next Steps

1. Create enhanced database schema
2. Implement backend services
3. Create API endpoints
4. Build frontend components
5. Integrate BlockNote.js editor
6. Add file management
7. Implement PDF export

Would you like me to start implementing this step by step? I can begin with the database schema and backend services, then move to the frontend components.
